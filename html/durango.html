          <h3>Check out our charming downtown</h3>

          Durango's <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/pDDFJAQsn33pjB8g9">historic
          downtown</a> has tons of great food and drink, shopping,
          live music, views, and the charm of an old Western town. Ask
          us for our favorite spots!
        </li>

          <h3>Take a hike</h3>

          The <a href="https://www.durangotrails.org/trails/animas-river-trail/">Animas
          River Trail</a> is great for a quick walk or a pleasant bike
          ride through the heart of Durango. If you're feeling up for
          some elevation gain,
          try <a href="https://www.durangotrails.org/trails/animas-mountain-trail-system/">Animas
          City Mountain</a>,
          the <a href="https://www.durangotrails.org/trails/overend-mountain-park/hogsback-trail/">Hogback</a>,
          or the
          <a href="https://www.durangotrails.org/trails/fort-lewis-trail-system/skyline-trail/">Skyline
          Trail</a>. Driving up to Silverton or the La Plata Mountains
          will blow you away with high alpine vistas and fresh
          mountain air. Trail runners and mountain bikers will love
          all these areas as well.

          <h3>Raft the Animas River</h3>

          Right in the middle of the city, the Animas has anything
          from mellow flatwater that's great for SUPing or a lazy
          float, all the way to Class III rapids at the whitewater
          park south of downtown. You can rent duckies or rafts, as
          well as hire a guide for the day,
          from <a href="https://mild2wildrafting.com/">Mild 2
          Wild</a>.

          <h3>Explore history and science</h3>

          The <a href="https://www.animasmuseum.org/">Animas
          Museum</a> has lots of interesting artifacts showcasing the
          fascinating history of this area. It is located in an old
          schoolhouse with the teacherâ€™s log cabin next door. (Fun
          fact: we went here while Celeste was looking for a new car,
          long before we ever started dating.) Another fun,
          family-oriented museum is
          the <a href="https://powsci.org/">Powerhouse</a> a hands-on
          science museum located in an old power station right on the
          river.

          <h3>Take the historic train to Silverton</h3>

          The <a href="https://www.durangotrain.com/">Durango Silverton
          Narrow Gauge Railroad</a> is an old train line that was used
          during the mining era and still runs. It follows the Animas
          River from Durango to Silverton and looks extremely
          beautiful (though we've never actually ridden it).
